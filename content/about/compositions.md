Here are some of my musical compositions that can be found on my Musescore account.

[Short Guitar Piece in E minor](https://musescore.com/user/97027930/scores/27620305)
> A two-voice piece in 3/8. Uses relatively simple chord progressions to temporarily modulate to different keys.

[Prelude in C minor](https://musescore.com/user/97027930/scores/27609100)
> A piano prelude where the first half resembles a figuration prelude, and the latter half begins in b-flat minor, and reaches back to the key of C.

[Short Piece in G minor](https://musescore.com/user/97027930/scores/29166134)
> A Corelli-like trio sonata movement with added basso continuo. The main feature of this piece is the simple melody of the upper violin.
